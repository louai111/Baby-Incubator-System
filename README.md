## Overview

This project integrates Arduino and Python to create a comprehensive health monitoring system that tracks multiple vital parameters—such as heart rate, SpO₂ levels, temperature, and humidity—alongside jaundice detection using an RGB color sensor. Additionally, the system serves as a **basic incubator controller** by monitoring and regulating temperature and humidity, which are essential for neonatal care. Data collected by Arduino from the sensors is transmitted to a computer, where a Python PyQt-based interface visualizes ECG signals in real-time.

Our incubator system draws inspiration from the paper "Designing a Low-Cost Multifunctional Infant Incubator" published in the Journal of the Association for Laboratory Automation by Kevin Tran, Aaron Gibson, Don Wong, Dagmawi Tilahun, Nicholas Selock, Theresa Good, Geetha Ram, Leah Tolosa, Michael Tolosa, Yordan Kostov, and others. This study outlines innovative approaches to neonatal care, focusing on cost-effective, modular designs, and infection control measures. By integrating the scientifically proven methods described in the paper, we have ensured that our incubator aligns with evidence-based best practices, making it practical and impactful in addressing critical challenges in low-resource settings.

This figure demonstrates the modularity and cost-efficiency of the design. It illustrates how the disposable infant chamber is made from insulated cardboard and flat-packed for easy assembly. This chamber integrates seamlessly with a reusable control module that includes temperature regulation and power systems. Additionally, an optional cooling module, designed to accommodate diverse environmental needs, can be attached to enhance functionality.

The thermal analysis in this figure highlights the importance of precise heat insulation. A controlled environmental chamber replicates varying climates to test temperature stability. The incubator’s lid, made of triple-paned clear polyvinylchloride (PVC) film, offers superior insulation while maintaining visibility, reducing energy loss, and ensuring a stable internal environment for neonatal care.

This sequence showcases the step-by-step assembly of the flat-packable infant chamber. The lightweight and disposable design emphasizes portability and cost-effectiveness, catering to low-resource settings. The final prototype combines ease of use with innovative thermal management solutions, such as the optional cooling unit and a thermal bank, tailored for extended off-grid operation.
