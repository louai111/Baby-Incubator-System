# Low Cost Baby Incubator With Health Monitoring and ECG Visualization Capabilities

This project integrates Arduino and Python to create a comprehensive health monitoring system that tracks multiple vital parameters—such as heart rate, SpO₂ levels, temperature, and humidity—alongside jaundice detection using an RGB color sensor. Additionally, the system serves as a **basic incubator controller** by monitoring and regulating temperature and humidity, which are essential for neonatal care. Data collected by Arduino from the sensors is transmitted to a computer, where a Python PyQt-based interface visualizes ECG signals in real-time.

## Overview

This health monitoring and ECG visualization system is designed with neonatal applications in mind, especially for incubator settings. It comprises two main components:

- **Arduino**: Reads data from a variety of sensors (heart rate, SpO₂, temperature, humidity, and RGB) and transmits it to a connected computer.
- **Python PyQt GUI**: Uses PyQtGraph for real-time ECG visualization, displaying dynamic, animated waveforms based on collected heart rate data.

## Key Features

- **Heart Rate and SpO₂ Monitoring**: Utilizing the MAX30100 sensor for accurate BPM and blood oxygen levels.
- **Temperature and Humidity Tracking**: Employs the DHT11 sensor to gauge environmental conditions.
- **Jaundice Detection**: Measures RGB color values through an RGB sensor to aid in jaundice assessment.
- **Incubator Temperature Control**: Basic functionality to regulate temperature via relay and fan control, enabling essential thermal management.
- **ECG Visualization**: Displays animated ECG data, derived from BPM input, to provide a clear, live representation of cardiac activity.

## Mobile Interface

A mobile app interface was also developed for remote monitoring capabilities.
